# Machine Learning

This project features some of the most well-known machine learning algorithms, including Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Recommendation Systems. 

The code is organized into four categories: Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Recommendation Systems. Each category includes various projects that demonstrate the respective algorithms. 

For example, if you're interested in regression algorithms, you can navigate to the Regression category, where you'll find the algorithms organized by their names and the corresponding datasets. Additionally, the datasets are made available for easy download within each category.
